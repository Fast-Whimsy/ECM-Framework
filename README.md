OVERVIEW
The Entangled Coherence Model (ECM) is the foundational framework in the Fast Whimsy coherence-architecture lineage. It introduces a minimal, domain-neutral tri-lens structure for evaluating the coherence of worldviews, systems, and interpretive models. ECM is the root node for all downstream frameworks: CMF, CMF-Diamond, and HECM. This repository provides the canonical home for the ECM manuscript, diagrams, axioms, collapse modes, and lineage notes.

PURPOSE
ECM defines the minimal conceptual geometry required for any coherence-evaluation system. It establishes the three irreducible lenses, the collapse modes, the coherence operator, the mutual constraint relations, and the axioms of irreducibility and balance. Downstream models must preserve these structures and justify any extensions using Occam’s operator.
THE THREE LENSES
ECM identifies three structural domains present in all worldviews.

PHYSICS LENS (Empirical Constraint)
Empirical adequacy, measurement, causal structure, predictive reliability.

METAPHYSICS LENS (Ontological Constraint)
Coherence, identity, modality, structural intelligibility.

THEOLOGY LENS (Existential Constraint)
Meaning, value, purpose, orientation. Used in a domain-neutral sense.

These lenses are irreducible and mutually constraining.

COLLAPSE MODES
Worldviews collapse when one lens dominates.

Reductionism: physics overrides ontology and meaning.
Abstraction Drift: metaphysics detaches from empirical constraint.
Dogma: existential commitments override evidence and structure.

These collapse modes remain valid diagnostic categories for all downstream frameworks.

COHERENCE ARCHITECTURE
Coherence is the simultaneous satisfaction of all three lenses.

Coherence Operator:
C(x) is true when P(x) and M(x) and T(x) are all satisfied.

Mutual Constraint Relation:
Each lens constrains and is constrained by the others.

Irreducibility Axiom:
No lens reduces to another.
REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
This repository contains the canonical ECM artifacts.

manuscript
Contains ECM\_v1\_manuscript.md, the full manuscript.

diagrams
Contains the tri-lens diagram and related visual references.

axioms
Contains the formal axioms, operators, and definitions.

collapse\_modes
Contains descriptions of the three collapse modes.

lineage
Contains lineage notes and the ECM anchor JSON for downstream frameworks.

archive
Contains the rejected manuscript and salvage notes.

LINEAGE POSITION
ECM is the origin point of the coherence lineage.

ECM leads to CMF.
CMF leads to CMF-Diamond.
CMF-Diamond leads to HECM.

Downstream frameworks inherit:
tri-lens geometry
collapse modes
coherence operator
mutual constraint relations
irreducibility axioms

No downstream model may contradict these structures.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT
ECM originated from a question raised by Dr. Martha Nanette Harrell, Ph.D., Information System Science, whose early inquiry initiated the publication sequence and collaborative arc.

DOI
This repository is prepared for DOI minting via Zenodo. Once the CMF DOI is issued, ECM will be minted as the root DOI for the lineage.

PURPOSE FOR FUTURE RESEARCHERS
This repository preserves the conceptual root of the coherence lineage. It provides a stable foundation for future manuscripts, supports onboarding for researchers and students, and maintains continuity across the Fast Whimsy research program. ECM is the seed crystal from which the entire coherence architecture grows.
END OF DOCUMENT NOTES
This README is intentionally flattened to ensure compatibility with GitHub’s web editor and automated formatting agents. It contains no Markdown headings, no nested lists, and no code fences. All structural hierarchy is expressed through plain text section labels.

This file serves as the authoritative description of the ECM-Framework repository and its role as the root node of the coherence lineage. All downstream repositories (CMF-Framework, CMF-Diamond, HECM) inherit conceptual constraints from ECM and must maintain continuity with its definitions.

This repository is now ready for:
DOI minting
manuscript evaluation
lineage mapping
future researcher onboarding
integration with Fast Whimsy’s long-term research program

ECM is the seed crystal of the coherence lineage.
