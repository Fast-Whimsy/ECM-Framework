Author:
Steve [Surname Redacted]

Reviewer:

• Anchors the lineage metadata for the ECM repository.

Archival Purpose:
This file is preserved to:
• Maintain provenance for DOI minting.
• Provide historical continuity for the ECM lineage.
• Document the original conceptual structure prior to later refinements.
