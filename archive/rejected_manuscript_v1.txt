Abstract
Human worldviews—scientific, philosophical, and theological—attempt to answer three foundational questions: What is real? What holds it together? What does it mean for us? These questions correspond to three irreducible interpretive domains: empirical description, ontological structure, and existential orientation. Contemporary discourse often isolates these domains, producing worldviews that collapse into reductionism, abstraction drift, or dogma. This paper introduces the Entangled Coherence Model (ECM), a minimal, domain neutral, tri lens framework designed to evaluate the structural coherence of worldviews across disciplines. ECM formalizes three interpretive lenses (physics, metaphysics, theology), defines their mutual constraints, identifies characteristic collapse modes, and specifies the conditions under which a worldview achieves coherence. The framework is presented diagrammatically and axiomatized formally. ECM is compared to adjacent integrative theories and demonstrated through applications in scientific interpretation, metaphysics, and theology. The result is a generalizable, falsifiable, and methodologically neutral tool for interdisciplinary evaluation.

1. Introduction
Across cultures and eras, human inquiry has revolved around three persistent questions:
1. What is real?
2. What holds it together?
3. What does it mean for us?
These questions appear in different vocabularies—scientific, philosophical, theological—but they remain structurally invariant. They correspond to three interpretive domains that recur throughout intellectual history:
• empirical description
• ontological explanation
• existential orientation
Despite their interdependence, modern intellectual life often isolates these domains. Scientific worldviews collapse into reductionism, metaphysical systems drift into abstraction, and theological frameworks risk dogma. The result is fragmentation: worldviews that are internally inconsistent, incomplete, or incapable of addressing the full range of human concerns.
This paper introduces the Entangled Coherence Model (ECM), a minimal, tri lens framework designed to evaluate the coherence of worldviews across disciplines. ECM does not prescribe beliefs. It provides a structural method for determining whether a worldview satisfies the empirical, ontological, and existential constraints necessary for coherence. The aim is not unification but balance. ECM identifies the minimal set of constraints required for a worldview to be structurally stable.

2. The Three Lenses
ECM identifies three irreducible interpretive lenses. These lenses are not optional; they are structural features of any worldview that attempts to describe reality, explain its structure, and orient human life within it.

2.1 The Physics Lens (Empirical Constraint)
The physics lens encompasses:
• empirical adequacy
• measurement
• causal structure
• predictive reliability
It asks: What can be observed, tested, or modeled?
This lens includes but is not limited to physics as a discipline. It represents the empirical dimension of any worldview.

2.2 The Metaphysics Lens (Ontological Constraint)
The metaphysics lens concerns:
• coherence
• identity
• modality
• structural intelligibility
It asks: What must be true for the world to make sense?
This lens governs the ontological commitments that underlie empirical claims.

2.3 The Theology Lens (Existential Constraint)
The theology lens addresses:
• meaning
• value
• purpose
• orientation
It asks: Why does any of this matter, and what is our place within it?
ECM uses “theology” in a broad, domain neutral sense. It does not require religious commitment; it refers to the existential dimension present in all worldviews.

3. Collapse Modes
Worldviews that rely disproportionately on one interpretive lens exhibit predictable structural failures. These collapse modes are not moral judgments but diagnostic categories that identify where a worldview has lost coherence. Reductionism and metaphysical inflation are well documented risks in scientific and philosophical systems. ECM formalizes these risks as three distinct collapse modes.

3.1 Reductionism (Physics Collapse)
A worldview collapses into reductionism when empirical description is treated as the only legitimate domain. This collapse mode denies or minimizes ontological structure and existential meaning. Examples include eliminative materialism, strict physicalism, and strong forms of scientism. Reductionism produces worldviews that are empirically grounded yet ontologically thin and existentially inert.

3.2 Abstraction Drift (Metaphysics Collapse)
A worldview collapses into abstraction drift when ontological speculation becomes unconstrained by empirical evidence or existential relevance. This collapse mode appears in overly elaborate metaphysical systems, speculative cosmologies, or frameworks that multiply entities without corresponding explanatory gain. Abstraction drift produces worldviews that are internally intricate but disconnected from empirical reality.

3.3 Existential Collapse (Meaning Collapse)
A worldview collapses into existential rigidity when meaning, value, or purpose override empirical and ontological constraints. This collapse mode appears in ideological systems, identity based frameworks, and meaning first worldviews that resist revision. Existential collapse produces worldviews that may be emotionally compelling yet structurally fragile.

4. Diagrammatic Architecture
ECM’s structure can be represented diagrammatically through three conceptual models: the Tri Lens Diagram, the Coherence Zone Diagram, and the Constraint Manifold. These diagrams illustrate the mutual constraint relations among the lenses and the structural conditions for coherence.

Physics (P)
The tri lens structure can be conceptualized as a three dimensional constraint manifold with axes corresponding to the three lenses. A worldview is coherent if it lies within the interior region defined by the intersection of the three constraint surfaces. Collapse modes correspond to boundary regions where one or more constraints are violated.

5. Formal Axiomatic System
ECM’s formal structure is defined by a set of primitive terms, derived terms, definitions, axioms, and theorems.

5.1 Primitive Terms
• (P): Physics lens
• (M): Metaphysics lens
• (E): Existential lens

5.2 Coherence Operator
A worldview x is coherent if and only if it satisfies all three lenses:
C(x) ↔ P(x) ∧ M(x) ∧ E(x)

5.3 Collapse Modes
• Reductionism:
R_p(x) ↔ P(x) ∧ ¬M(x) ∧ ¬E(x)
• Abstraction Drift:
R_m(x) ↔ M(x) ∧ ¬P(x) ∧ ¬E(x)
• Existential Collapse:
R_e(x) ↔ E(x) ∧ ¬P(x) ∧ ¬M(x)

5.4 Axioms
Lens Sovereignty: P ≠ M ≠ E  
Irreducibility: No lens reduces to another.  
Mutual Constraint: Each lens constrains and is constrained by the others.  
Coherence Requirement: C(x) ↔ P(x) ∧ M(x) ∧ E(x)  
Constraint Necessity: If any lens is violated, coherence fails.  
Constraint Sufficiency: If all lenses are satisfied, coherence holds.  
Collapse Definition: Each collapse mode is defined by exclusive satisfaction of a single lens.  
Collapse Exclusivity: A worldview cannot occupy more than one collapse mode.  
Domain Completeness: The three lenses exhaust the interpretive space.  
Non Hierarchy: No lens is privileged over another.

6. Comparative Analysis
ECM is not the first attempt to articulate structural relationships among domains of inquiry. This section compares ECM to adjacent frameworks and clarifies its distinctiveness.

6.1 Process Philosophy  
Process ontology emphasizes becoming over being. ECM differs by treating metaphysical structure as one lens among three, not as a totalizing ontology.

6.2 Integral Theory  
Integral Theory proposes hierarchical integration across domains. ECM rejects hierarchy in favor of mutual constraint and lens sovereignty.

6.3 NOMA  
NOMA separates science and religion into non interacting domains. ECM rejects isolationism, arguing that empirical, ontological, and existential claims inevitably constrain one another.

6.4 Consciousness Frameworks  
Contemporary theories of consciousness often privilege metaphysics or phenomenology. ECM treats consciousness as requiring all three lenses.

6.5 Science–Religion Boundary  
Conflict models treat science and religion as competing explanatory systems. ECM reframes the issue structurally: conflicts arise when one lens attempts to dominate the others.

7. Applications
ECM is designed as a domain neutral structural tool.

7.1 Quantum Mechanics  
Interpretations privilege different lenses. ECM evaluates them structurally.

7.2 Cosmology  
Inflationary multiverse theories raise ontological concerns. ECM identifies which constraints are being neglected.

7.3 Existential Reasoning  
Existential reasoning is a structural component of coherence.

8. Discussion
ECM contributes to debates concerning pluralism, realism, and the structure of explanation. It aligns with pluralistic approaches while maintaining a coherence requirement that prevents relativism. ECM is falsifiable: if a worldview violates a lens yet remains coherent, ECM fails.

9. Conclusion
Worldviews must satisfy empirical, ontological, and existential constraints to achieve coherence. ECM provides a minimal, formal, and domain neutral framework for evaluating this structure.
