ECM LINEAGE NOTES



ECM-Framework is the root node of the coherence lineage.



Lineage sequence:

ECM → CMF-Framework → CMF-Diamond → HECM



ECM provides:

tri-lens geometry

collapse modes

coherence operator

mutual constraint relations

irreducibility axioms



All downstream frameworks inherit these structures and must not contradict them.



This file records lineage-relevant context, identity microdata, and continuity constraints.
